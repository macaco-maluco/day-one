## Population

- Doesn't grow on ship
- Grows as steady linear rate on planets
- Can be transferred to and from planets in minimum increments (for example 100, add 100, take 100)
- Needs to be above a threshold. If it ever gets below, the player loses the game
- If it reaches certain threshold, the player gets awarded (they "win")

## Energy

- Is spent at a fix rate by existing
- Put a fix rate to create a dyson swarm (wait for the dyson swarm to be finished)
- Grows as steady linear rate on completed dyson swarms
- Collect all-that-you-can-carry

## Solar System

- We want to be "realistic". Massive stars exist closer to the beginning. Smaller throughout the entire lifespan of the universe
